This program is the code for simulating the recurrent equation model and fitting it to experimental data. 
The original data is the file “Cheng_24hr_data (revision).xlsx” in folder “data_and_parameters”.
The parameters from curve fitting are the files “Dx_steady_state_nonlinear_3_27-Mar-2023_2modules.mat” and “Dx_steady_state_nonlinear_3_27-Mar-2023_3modules.mat” in folder “data_and_parameters”.
The functions of the recurrent equation model are in folder “matlab_code\model_functions”.
The functions used for reading and writing data and figures are in folder “matlab_code\output_functions”.
The code for fitting the experimental data is in folder “matlab_code\model_fitting”
The example codes for drawing figures in the paper are in folder “matlab_code\figure_code_examples”
